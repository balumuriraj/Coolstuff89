This project is performed on various multivariate gesture datasets where each gesture is represented by the recordings of 20 sensors, each in turn has 4 components W, X, Y, Z. Firstly, for a given gesture dataset, we have calculated TF, TF-IDF and TF-IDF2 vectors for each gesture file to form the gesture database. We used these vectors for similarity search to retrieve files similar to a query gesture. Then, we have performed dimensionality reduction on this database using the techniques Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to improve efficiency. Then we have developed clusters by performing PCA and SVD on gesture-gesture similarity matrix (unsupervised learning). In the final phase, we have developed a random hash function based index structure for the database using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique and used it for similarity search. Then we have performed gesture classification using n-ary Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and decision tree based algorithms (supervised learning) to learn the classes of unclassified data.",
